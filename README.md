# Breathing Excersize App
This project is a Breathing Excersize app to help you with controlled breathing.
## Motivation
My motivation for this project was to ease people's minds and possibly help with their mental status. 
I feel like the benefits of a simple breathing excersize a couple minutes a day could be immense.
